    <h1>Beer Butt Chicken</h1>

<p>For this beer butter chicken, all you need is a whole chicken, beer, butter, and seasonings. The chicken is seasoned and slowly cooked on the grill. This is a bit unorthodox, but the end result is moist and flavorful.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons paprika, divided</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can beer</li>
    <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
<li>Melt 1/2 cup butter in a small skillet. Mix in 1 tablespoon garlic salt, 1 tablespoon paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
<li>Discard 1/2 of the beer, leaving the remainder in the can. Add remaining butter, garlic salt, paprika, salt, and pepper to the beer can. Place the can on a baking sheet or disposable pan. Set chicken upright on the beer can, inserting the can into the cavity of the chicken. Baste chicken with melted, seasoned butter.
</li>
<li>Place the baking sheet with beer and chicken on the preheated grill. Cook over low heat until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
<li>Remove from the grill, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
</ol>
